# weather-app-project
In this project I was asked to create a weather forecasting app using third party apis. I honestly struggled with this project. It was definitely the most challenging so far. I started with creating the search function that displayed weather conditions and also created buttons that could return the same weather data after clicking on the button after searching another city that utilized local storage. Then I worked on displaying the actual weather data and then finally the 5 day forecast. 

Here is a screenshot of the application:
